# Classify-Falls-ML
This repo is for Queen's University ELEC 498 2018-2019 Group 2 Project. We seek to classify different movements gotten from smartphone sensors as either falling or not falling. We hope to use Python and Tensorflow intitally, then eventually code our own back-propagation algorithm to replace the Tenserflow libraries.

# Setup
1. Download Github Desktop
2. Sign in to Github Desktop (or Create an Account)
3. Download Python version 3.6.7 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-367/) (because TensorFlow is not compatible with the latest version, 3.7)
4. Download VSCode and Python plugin (the latter done by clicking on bottom left corner gear, 'Extensions')
5. Once Isabel has added you to the repo as collaborator, you can clone the repo onto your local machine.
6. To run the python file, open up command line and do: 
`cd C:\your-repo-path`
(To find your-repo-path, once have gotten repo cloned on GH Desktop, click Repository->'Show in Explorer', and copy that path)
`python helloworld2.py`
7. Install TensorFlow library: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip?lang=python2
