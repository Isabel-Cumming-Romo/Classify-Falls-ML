# Classify-Falls-ML
This repo is for Queen's University ELEC 498 2018-2019 Group 2 Project. We seek to classify different movements gotten from smartphone sensors as either falling or not falling. We hope to use Python and Tensorflow intitally, then eventually code our own back-propagation algorithm to replace the Tenserflow libraries.
